# Imagery adds sensory evidence

Detection task: detect grating in noise while

- imagining the same grating
- imagining a perpendicular grating
- nothing

Imagery: factor with 3 levels

## Methods

50 participants (34 would have been required)
online
40 mins

imagery check

final data set: **41 particiapnts**

### Experimental procedure

Gratings faded in 

> bad idea

- Participants were instructed to detect gratings that gradually appeared in
dynamic noise while simultaneously imagining the same grating (congruent
condition), a grating perpendicular to the presented grating (incongruent), or
nothing (no imagery). 

- Prior to the main experiment, participants filled out the
VVIQ2 (Marks, 1995), which we used to instruct participants what we meant by the
concept of mental imagery.

- After this, participants first practiced detecting gratings with a high
  contrast until they responded correctly on at least 75% of the trials, making
  sure they understood the task.

- Then, participants practiced imagining the gratings while looking at the
dynamic noise for 20 trials in a row, 10 per orientation. They were instructed
to imagine the grating “as if it was actually presented.” After each trial,
participants were asked to indicate the vividness of their imagery using
a scale from 1 to 5

- In order to avoid visual priming, no trial-wise cues were delivered, and
  instead the different conditions were implemented in a block-wise fashion such
  that during the entire block, participants detected one specific orientation
  and imagined one specific orientation.

- There were **12 blocks**, two per condition (orientation × imagery), each
  consisting of 42 trials.

  - orientation (2) x imagery (3) = 6 combinations
  - 2 blocks per combination
- Each trial started with a 200-ms fixation cross followed by 2s of
  either pure dynamic white noise or dynamic white noise within which a gradually
  appearing stimulus was embedded.

- Imagery check: after each block, participants were asked which, if any, stimulus they had
  imagined during this block, to ensure that they had correctly followed the
  instructions.

- we also asked participants whether they thought imagining the gratings had
  altered their responses on the detection task.

### Stimuli

- sinusoidal grating at an orientation of 45 or 135 deg masked with an annulus and
  embedded in white noise
- Seven visibility levels were used: 0%, 3.7%, 4.8%, 5.3%, 6.1%, 7.3%, and 14%
- The exact values of the visibility levels were predetermined via piloting to
  allow for accurate estimation of the psychometric curves. For each orientation
  separately, 50 stimulus images were generated and distributed equally in log
  space across the seven visibility levels (from 0% to 14%)
- For the pure noise trials, an additional 20 images of pure white noise were generated.
- For the trials with a visibility level above zero, 20 stimulus images ranging
  from zero visibility to that specific visibility level were presented over the
  course of 2 s, giving the impression that the stimulus was gradually appearing
  in the noise.
